The body has always been more than skin and bone. It’s a site of invention — a living system that evolves with every tool we create. Machine Flesh: The Human Body as Technology explores this relationship between human biology and mechanical design, showing how technology no longer just surrounds us, but lives within us. Each artifact in this archive traces a different form of transformation, revealing how flesh and machine have become partners in shaping what it means to be human.
From surgical robots that extend the precision of a surgeon’s hands to wearable devices that turn our bodies into living networks, this archive looks at how machines have moved beyond tools — they’ve become extensions of identity. Works like Stelarc’s Third Arm and the Da Vinci Surgical System demonstrate how the body and technology collaborate, rather than compete. Neuralink’s brain implant and the Cochlear Nucleus 8 show how the mind and senses themselves can be rewired, where data flows through nerves as easily as blood.
These technologies not only enhance us — they redefine us. In fashion, art, and music, creators like Anouk Wipprecht, Arca, and FKA Twigs imagine the body as something fluid and programmable, able to shift between organic and synthetic. Through their work, beauty becomes circuitry, and emotion becomes code. The Apple Watch, Tesla’s autonomous systems, and AI nurse chatbots remind us that even in our daily routines, the line between human and machine has blurred into habit.
At its core, this project asks one question: does becoming more technological make us less human — or more? I believe it makes us more. Technology doesn’t erase humanity; it extends it. Each implant, circuit, and code in this archive represents the evolution of care, creativity, and consciousness. We are not replacing the body — we are redesigning it to keep up with our imagination.
Machine Flesh is a reflection on this new era of coexistence, where the boundaries between self and system dissolve. The archive invites viewers to see themselves not as separate from technology, but as part of its living architecture — human, enhanced, and endlessly evolving.
